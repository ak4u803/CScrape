## Testing

All scrapers have been tested and verified to load correctly:

```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

manager = ScraperManager('config.yaml')
sites = manager.get_available_sites()
print(f"Available sites: {sites}")
print(f"Total scrapers: {len(sites)}")
```

**Output:**
```
Available sites: ['amazon', 'ebay', 'walmart', 'target', 'bestbuy', 'newegg', 'etsy', 'aliexpress']
Total scrapers: 8
```

## How to Use New Scrapers

### Example 1: Search All Sites (Including New Ones)
```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

scraper = ScraperManager()
results = scraper.search_all_sites_combined("wireless mouse")
print(f"Found {len(results)} products across all 8 sites")
```

### Example 2: Search Specific New Sites
```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

scraper = ScraperManager()

# Search only Target and Best Buy
results = scraper.search_specific_sites(
    "gaming keyboard",
    sites=['target', 'bestbuy']
)

for site, products in results.items():
    print(f"{site}: {len(products)} products")
```

### Example 3: Search Electronics-Focused Sites
```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

scraper = ScraperManager()

# Perfect for tech shopping
tech_sites = ['amazon', 'bestbuy', 'newegg', 'walmart']
results = scraper.search_specific_sites(
    "RTX 4080",
    sites=tech_sites
)
```

### Example 4: Search for Unique/Handmade Items
```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

scraper = ScraperManager()

# Search Etsy for handmade items
results = scraper.search_specific_sites(
    "custom leather wallet",
    sites=['etsy']
)
```

### Example 5: Compare International Prices
```python
from scrapers import ScraperManager

scraper = ScraperManager()

# Compare domestic vs international prices
results = scraper.search_specific_sites(
    "phone case",
    sites=['amazon', 'walmart', 'aliexpress']
)
```

## Configuration Options

All new scrapers can be enabled/disabled in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
sites:
  target:
    enabled: true  # Set to false to disable
  
  bestbuy:
    enabled: true
  
  newegg:
    enabled: true
  
  etsy:
    enabled: true
  
  aliexpress:
    enabled: true
```

## Architecture

Each new scraper follows the same architecture:

1. **Inherits from `BaseScraper`** - Gets all common functionality
2. **Implements required methods:**
   - `site_name` property - Returns the site identifier
   - `scrape_product(url)` - Scrapes a single product page
   - `search_products(query, max_results)` - Searches and returns product list
3. **Uses configuration from `config.yaml`** - CSS selectors, search URLs
4. **Includes error handling and logging** - Robust scraping with retries
5. **Rate limiting** - Respects site resources

## Benefits of New Scrapers

1. **Broader Coverage**: 8 sites means more comprehensive price comparison
2. **Specialized Markets**: 
   - Electronics (Best Buy, Newegg)
   - Handmade items (Etsy)
   - International deals (AliExpress)
   - General retail (Target)
3. **Better Price Discovery**: More sources = better chance of finding deals
4. **User Choice**: Let users pick their preferred retailers
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare pricing strategies across different market segments

## Notes

- All scrapers use the same standardized product data format
- CSS selectors may need updates if sites change their HTML structure
- Rate limiting is enforced to be respectful to the websites
- Each scraper has comprehensive error handling and logging
- All scrapers support concurrent execution for fast results
